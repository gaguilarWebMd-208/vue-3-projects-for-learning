# Vue 3 Projects Monorepo

This repository contains multiple Vue 3 projects I've built. Each project is self-contained and can be run independently using Vite.
The purpose of this repository is to provide patterns to follow for frontend developers coming from React or Angular to have an idea of how Vue 3 works.
You can download each project and run it locally, add tests and anything else that you might feel is needed to help understand Vue 3 ins and outs.

This project was tested with AxeDev Tools and displays what a screen reader will output to a user that relies on assistive technologies. 
The importance of using labels is a crucial thing and at times many don't know that a simple adjustment can make the largest difference. 
There are also issues many times when individuals that have impaired vision have a hard time seeing shades of gray which might not be so obvious at first.
